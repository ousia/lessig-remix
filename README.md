# A `markdown` version from Lawrence Lessig, _Remix_

I want to ouput _Remix: Making Art and Commerce Thrive in the Hybrid Economy_ by Lawrence Lessig in ePub format.

It will take long before I could offer a readable version (partly it's the original file, partly it's the `markdown` format, and partly it's the `pandoc` tool).

I had a previous version using `textile`, but I switched to extended `markdown`, since it is a much better way to handle multi-paragraph elements.

## A note on notes

The original book has many notes, not only footnotes, but also endnotes (althought numbered footnotes are located in a special chapter at the end of the book, and star endnotes are located at the botton of the page). 

Non-numbered endnotes are simply not implemented in `markdown`, so they are implemented as standard footnotes.

The other issue with footnotes is that there are many of them and it isn't always easy to locate them in text. I will be adding them to the source as fast as I can discover them in the text. The task won't be easy, because footnote numbers are reset on each chapter.
